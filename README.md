# String Calculator TDD Kata

This project is an implementation of the String Calculator Kata using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal of this exercise was to practice TDD principles by incrementally building a string calculator.

## How I Did It

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Followed the TDD cycle of Red-Green-Refactor to implement each feature.
2. **Incremental Development**: Added functionality step-by-step based on the requirements of the kata.
3. **Refactoring**: Continuously improved the code to ensure readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Technology Used

- **Programming Language**: Ruby
- **Testing Framework**: RSpec

## Gems Used

- `rspec` - For writing and running unit tests.
- `simplecov` - For tracking test coverage and ensuring code quality.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `bundle install`.
3. Run tests using `rspec`.
